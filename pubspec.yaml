    # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
    # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
    # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
    # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
    # example:
    # fonts:
    #   - family: Schyler
    #     fonts:
    #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
    #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
    #         style: italic
    #   - family: Trajan Pro
    #     fonts:
    #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
    #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
